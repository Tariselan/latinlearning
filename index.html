    <h1>Main Page</h1>
    <p>This is a site created purely out of the fact that I, the creator of this, am a master of both procrastination and automation. I have been meaning to (for 3 years now) learn my Latin endings and such, have I done as such? Nay.</p>
    <p>So obviously the most obvious plan of action to continue is not simply write them out and memorise over time but instead to make a website, copy out tables, and code up memorisation games. As one does.</p>
    <p>Am I, in any way shape or form, good at coding? No, I simply just push codes out as time goes on. I am, however, relatively well versed in linguistics. Why? Conlangs and Wikipedia rabbit holes that can go on for over 5+ hours at a time.</p>
    <p>This resource/project is mainly for personal use but feel free to use it at your own goals may make thee to pursue.</p>
